The model was now been trained using logistics regression and the model was evaluated with the accuracy to be 97%. Similarly, the accuracy on test data was 97%. 

### CONCLUSION
Samples email was used to check the prediction of the model having creating a library to interprete the outcome of the prediction whether the email will be spam of ham
The outcome of the prediction was sucessful as the model was able to classified whether an email is ham or spam.
